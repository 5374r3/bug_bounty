# What is authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a given user or client. In other words, it involves making sure that they really are who they claim to be

There are three authentication factors into which different types of authentication can be categorized:

- Something you **know**, such as a password or the answer to a security question. These are sometimes referred to as "knowledge factors".
- Something you **have**, that is, a physical object like a mobile phone or security token. These are sometimes referred to as "possession factors".
- Something you **are** or do, for example, your biometrics or patterns of behavior. These are sometimes referred to as "inherence factors".

### What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

**Authentication** is the process of verifying that a user really **is who they claim to be**, whereas **authorization** involves verifying whether a user **is allowed to do something**.
