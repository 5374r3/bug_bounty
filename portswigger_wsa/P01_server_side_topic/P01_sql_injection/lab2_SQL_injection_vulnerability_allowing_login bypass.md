>
> when we log in using username and password the query passed through the above example and if it match with database
> then you able to login successfully
> to bypass password credentials you will use -- it consider as comment in sql

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = 'administrator'
```
