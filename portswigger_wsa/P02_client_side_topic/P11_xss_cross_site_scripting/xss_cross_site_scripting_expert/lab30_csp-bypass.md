# Reflected XSS protected by CSP, with CSP bypass

## This lab uses [CSP](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/content-security-policy) and contains a [reflected XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected) vulnerability.

## To solve the lab, perform a [cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) attack that bypasses the CSP and calls the `alert` function.

## Please note that the intended solution to this lab is only possible in Chrome.
