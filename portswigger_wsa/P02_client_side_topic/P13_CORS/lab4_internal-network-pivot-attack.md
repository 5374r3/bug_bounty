## This website has an insecure [CORS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors) configuration in that it trusts all internal network origins.

## This lab requires multiple steps to complete. To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript to locate an endpoint on the local network (`192.168.0.0/24`, port `8080`) that you can then use to identify and create a CORS-based attack to delete a user. The lab is solved when you delete user `Carlos`.

### EXPERT lab pending
